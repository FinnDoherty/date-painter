### Development
Created using react and hosted on firebase.  
Data is stored in a firestore nosql db.  
The random code is created by choosing words from [mnemonic-words](https://github.com/sindresorhus/mnemonic-words) large list of words.  
The calendar widget is [react-multi-date-picker](https://github.com/shahabyazdi/react-multi-date-picker).  
All other css was created by me.
